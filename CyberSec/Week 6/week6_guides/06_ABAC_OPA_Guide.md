# Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with Open Policy Agent (OPA)

## Step 1: What is ABAC?

- **ABAC** is a security model where access control decisions are made based on attributes:
  - **User attributes**: Role, department, clearance level.
  - **Resource attributes**: File type, sensitivity, ownership.
  - **Environmental attributes**: Time, location, device, network.

- **Key Features**:
  - **Fine-Grained Control**: Flexible policies based on multiple attributes.
  - **Context-Aware**: Policies adapt to real-time changes in attributes.

---

## Step 2: What is Open Policy Agent (OPA)?

- **OPA** is an open-source policy engine for implementing ABAC.
- It uses **Rego**, a declarative language, to write and enforce policies.
- OPA can integrate with APIs, Kubernetes, microservices, and more.

## Step 3: Installing OPA

1. Download the OPA binary:

   ```bash
   curl -L -o opa https://openpolicyagent.org/downloads/v0.50.2/opa_linux_amd64
   ```

2. Make the binary executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x opa
   ```

3. Move the binary to your system's PATH:

   ```bash
   sudo mv opa /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   opa version
   ```

## Step 4: Writing ABAC Policies in OPA

### 1. Create a Policy File

Write policies using the **Rego** language in a `.rego` file. For example, create a file named `access.rego`:

```rego
package example

default allow = false

allow {
    input.user.department == "Finance"
    input.request.time >= "09:00"
    input.request.time <= "17:00"
    input.request.network == "corporate"
}
```

### 2. Explanation of the Policy

- The default `allow` decision is `false`.
- Access is granted only if:
  - The user belongs to the **Finance department**.
  - The request is made between **09:00 and 17:00**.
  - The request originates from the **corporate network**.

---

## Step 5: Testing the Policy

1. Create a JSON input file (`input.json`) to simulate access requests:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "department": "Finance"
  },
  "request": {
    "time": "10:00",
    "network": "corporate"
  }
}
```

2. Evaluate the policy with the input:

   ```bash
   opa eval -i input.json -d access.rego "data.example.allow"
   ```

3. Example Output:
   - If the conditions are met:

     ```json
     true
     ```

   - If the conditions are not met:

     ```json
     false
     ```

---

## Step 6: Integrating OPA with Applications

### 1. Run OPA as a Server

Start OPA in server mode:

```bash
opa run --server
```

### 2. Load the Policy and Data

Load your policy and input data into the running OPA instance:

```bash
curl -X PUT --data-binary @access.rego http://localhost:8181/v1/policies/access
curl -X PUT --data-binary @input.json http://localhost:8181/v1/data/example
```

### 3. Query the Policy via API

Make a query to evaluate the policy:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": {"user": {"department": "Finance"}, "request": {"time": "10:00", "network": "corporate"}}}' http://localhost:8181/v1/data/example/allow
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "result": true
}
```

## Step 7: Real-World Example: Protecting a Web Application

### Scenario

A web application allows access to sensitive reports only if:

1. The user is in the "Management" department.
2. The access request is made from a secure IP range.

1. Write the Policy (`report_access.rego`):

```rego
package reports

default allow = false

allow {
    input.user.department == "Management"
    input.request.ip in {"192.168.1.0/24"}
}
```

2. Test the Policy:

   ```bash
   opa eval -i input.json -d report_access.rego "data.reports.allow"
   ```

---

## Step 8: Monitor and Debug Policies

1. Check the logs of the OPA server:

   ```bash
   opa run --server --log-level debug
   ```

2. Use the OPA Playground:
   - Visit the OPA Playground online at <https://play.openpolicyagent.org/>.
   - Write and test policies interactively.

---

## Step 9: Best Practices for ABAC with OPA

1. **Use Meaningful Names**: Name policies and attributes clearly to reflect their purpose.
2. **Test Policies Regularly**: Use JSON inputs to simulate real-world scenarios.
3. **Start with Simple Policies**: Gradually build complexity to ensure clarity and maintainability.
4. **Use Rego Best Practices**: Avoid overly complex logic; break down policies into smaller rules.
