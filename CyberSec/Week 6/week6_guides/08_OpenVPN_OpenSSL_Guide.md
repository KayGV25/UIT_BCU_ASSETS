# Step-by-Step Guide: Setting Up OpenVPN with OpenSSL (Using ECC Certificates)

## Step 1: What is OpenVPN?

- **OpenVPN** is an open-source VPN solution that provides secure connections to private networks.
- This guide demonstrates how to replace EasyRSA with **OpenSSL** to generate **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** certificates for enhanced security and performance.

## Step 2: Installing Required Packages

1. **Update the System**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install OpenVPN and OpenSSL**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install openvpn openssl
   ```

---

## Step 3: Setting Up the Certificate Authority (CA)

1. **Generate an ECC Private Key for the CA**:

   ```bash
   openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out ca.key
   ```

   - **prime256v1**: A secure elliptic curve. You can use others, like `secp384r1`.

2. **Create a Self-Signed Certificate for the CA**:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 3650
   ```

   - Fill in the certificate details when prompted:
     - Common Name (CN): Use a descriptive name like "OpenVPN CA."

---

## Step 4: Generating the Server Certificate and Key

1. **Generate the Server's Private Key**:

   ```bash
   openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out server.key
   ```

2. **Create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for the Server**:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
   ```

3. **Sign the Server Certificate with the CA**:

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365
   ```

---

## Step 5: Generating the Client Certificate and Key

1. **Generate the Client's Private Key**:

   ```bash
   openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out client.key
   ```

2. **Create a CSR for the Client**:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
   ```

3. **Sign the Client Certificate with the CA**:

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365
   ```

---

## Step 6: Configuring the OpenVPN Server

1. **Copy Certificates and Keys to the OpenVPN Directory**:

   ```bash
   sudo cp ca.crt server.crt server.key /etc/openvpn/
   ```

2. **Edit the OpenVPN Server Configuration File**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/openvpn/server.conf
   ```

   Add or update the following lines:

   ```bash
   ca ca.crt
   cert server.crt
   key server.key
   push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"
   push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
   ```

3. **Enable IP Forwarding**:
   - Edit the sysctl configuration:

     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
     ```

   - Uncomment or add:

     ```bash
     net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
     ```

   - Apply the changes:

     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -p
     ```

4. **Set Up Firewall Rules**:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 1194/udp
   sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

---

## Step 7: Starting the OpenVPN Service

1. **Start the OpenVPN Server**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start openvpn@server
   ```

2. **Enable the Service to Start on Boot**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable openvpn@server
   ```

3. **Check the Service Status**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status openvpn@server
   ```

---

## Step 8: Configuring the Client

1. **Transfer the CA Certificate, Client Certificate, and Key**:
   Use `scp` or any secure method to transfer `ca.crt`, `client.crt`, and `client.key` to the client machine.

2. **Create a Client Configuration File**:

   ```bash
   nano client.ovpn
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```bash
   client
   dev tun
   proto udp
   remote <server-ip-address> 1194
   resolv-retry infinite
   nobind
   persist-key
   persist-tun
   ca ca.crt
   cert client.crt
   key client.key
   cipher AES-256-CBC
   verb 3
   ```

3. **Connect the Client**:
   Import the `.ovpn` file into the OpenVPN client application and connect.

---

## Step 9: Verifying the Setup

1. **Monitor Logs on the Server**:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u openvpn@server
   ```

2. **Verify Connected Clients**:

   ```bash
   sudo cat /etc/openvpn/openvpn-status.log
   ```

---

## Step 10: Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Encryption**:
   - Ensure all certificates use secure elliptic curves (e.g., `prime256v1`, `secp384r1`).

2. **Implement Access Control**:
   - Integrate OpenVPN with **FreeRADIUS** or another authentication system for centralized management.

3. **Enable Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Regularly review logs for anomalies and potential security breaches.
