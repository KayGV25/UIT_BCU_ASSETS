# Generating OpenSSL Documentation with Doxygen

This guide helps students generate help files using **Doxygen** to better understand the cryptographic algorithms in OpenSSL.

---

## Step 1: Install Doxygen and Graphviz

1. **Download Doxygen** from the official site:  
   [Doxygen Download](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)  
   Follow the instructions to install it.

2. **Download and Install Graphviz** (optional but recommended for diagrams):  
   [Graphviz Download](https://graphviz.org/download/)  
   Ensure Graphviz is added to your system **PATH** during installation.

3. **Verify Doxygen Installation**:  
   Open a command prompt or terminal and type:

   ```bash
   doxygen -v
   ```

   If installed correctly, the Doxygen version will be displayed.

---

## Step 2: Configure the Doxygen Project

1. **Navigate to the OpenSSL Source Directory** (where OpenSSL code is extracted):

   ```bash
   cd path\to\openssl
   ```

2. **Generate a Default Doxygen Configuration File**:

   ```bash
   doxygen -g Doxyfile
   ```

   This creates a `Doxyfile` configuration file.

---

## Step 3: Edit the Doxygen Configuration File

1. Open the `Doxyfile` in a text editor.
2. **Modify the following fields**:
   - Set the project name:

     ```
     PROJECT_NAME = "OpenSSL Documentation"
     ```

   - Specify the source directory:

     ```
     INPUT = ./path/to/openssl source code
     ```

   - Enable recursive scanning:

     ```
     RECURSIVE = YES
     ```

   - Set the output formats (HTML and optionally PDF):

     ```
     GENERATE_HTML = YES
     GENERATE_LATEX = YES
     ```

   - Enable diagrams (if Graphviz is installed):

     ```
     HAVE_DOT = YES
     ```

---

## Step 4: Generate the Documentation

1. **Run Doxygen**:  
   In the OpenSSL source directory, run:

   ```bash
   doxygen Doxyfile
   ```

   This generates documentation in the `html/` and `latex/` directories.

2. **View the HTML Documentation**:  
   Navigate to the `html/` folder and open `index.html` in a web browser.

---

## Step 5: Optional - Generate PDF Documentation

1. If LaTeX is installed, navigate to the `latex/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd latex
   ```

2. Run the following command to generate a PDF:

   ```bash
   make pdf
   ```

---

## Additional Notes

- **Exploring the Documentation**: Students can browse through HTML files to explore data structures, classes, and cryptographic algorithms implemented in OpenSSL.
- **Searching for Functions**: Use the search function within the generated documentation to locate specific cryptographic functions (e.g., AES, RSA, SHA-256).

This guide helps students create detailed documentation, providing deeper insights into OpenSSLâ€™s cryptographic algorithms and code structure.
