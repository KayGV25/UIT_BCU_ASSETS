# Setting Up MinGW64, C/C++ Development Libraries, and Visual Studio Code

This guide will walk you through the setup of a C/C++ development environment using **MinGW64**, **MSYS2**, and **Visual Studio Code** on Windows. Follow these steps to get started.

---

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight code editor with great support for C/C++ development.

1. Download Visual Studio Code from the official site: [VS Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2. Install it by following the instructions provided on the website.

---

## 2. Install MinGW-w64 for C/C++ Compilation

MinGW-w64 provides a compiler suite for Windows.

### 2.1. Install MSYS2

1. **Download MSYS2** from the official site: [MSYS2 Download](https://www.msys2.org/).
2. **Install MSYS2** by following the installation wizard.
3. **Update MSYS2 Packages**:
   Open the MSYS2 terminal and run:

   ```bash
   pacman -Syu
   pacman -Su
   ```

4. **Install GCC and G++ Compilers**:

   ```bash
   pacman -S git mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc base-devel
   pacman -S mingw-w64-cross-binutils
   ```

---

## 2.2. Set Windows Environment Variables

1. Open **System Properties**:
   - **Method 1**: Search for "env" and open "Edit the system environment variables."
   - **Method 2**: Control Panel → System → Advanced system settings → Advanced tab.
2. In **Environment Variables**:
   - Under "System variables," select **Path** and click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the following paths:

     ```
     C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
     C:\msys64\usr\bin
     ```

3. Make sure MinGW64 is installed in `C:\msys64`. If MSYS2 is installed elsewhere, replace the default paths above with the appropriate ones.

## 3. Compile the OpenSSL Library

OpenSSL is a robust library for implementing SSL and TLS protocols. Below are the steps to compile it with **G++** and **Clang++**.

### 3.1. Compile with G++

1. **Download OpenSSL** from: [OpenSSL Source](https://www.openssl.org/source/).
2. **Open MSYS2 MinGW64 terminal**.
3. **Navigate to the extracted OpenSSL directory** and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   **make clean
   ./Configure mingw64 --prefix=C:/openssl
   make CC="/mingw64/bin/gcc" CXX="/mingw64/bin/g++" -j 8
   **make test -j 8
   make install -j 8
   ```

   *(Adjust `-j <number>` according to your CPU thread count.)*

4. **Copy the Library and Header Files**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "include/openssl"
   mkdir lib
   cp *.h -p "include/openssl"
   cp *.a lib
   ```

5. **Add the folders** `include` and `lib` to your project directory.

---

## 4. Set Up Clang and Compile with Clang++

### 4.1. Install Clang

Run the following commands in the MSYS2 terminal:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-clang
```

### 4.2. Compile OpenSSL with Clang++

1. **Open MSYS2 MinGW64 terminal**.
2. **Navigate to the OpenSSL directory** and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ./Configure mingw64 --prefix=C:/openssl
   make CC=/mingw64/bin/clang -j 8
   make test -j 8
   make install -j 8
   ```

3. **Copy the Library and Header Files**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "include/opensslclang"
   mkdir lib
   cp *.h -p "include/opensslclang"
   cp *.a lib
   ```

4. **Add the folders** `include` and `lib` to your Clang project directory.

---

## 5. Verify the Setup

After completing the steps, you can test your setup:

1. Create a simple C++ program and save it in VS Code:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;

   int main() {
       cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. Compile it using G++ or Clang++:

   ```bash
   g++ -o hello hello.cpp
   ./hello

   clang++ -o hellocl hello.cpp
   ./hello
   ```
