# Setting Up Server Certificates with ECC for Apache Authentication

This guide provides instructions to set up ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) server certificates on an Apache server to enable secure authentication for users. Using ECC can provide strong security with smaller keys than RSA.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure OpenSSL is installed on your system.

---

## Step 1: Generate an ECC Private Key and Certificate Signing Request (CSR)

1. **Generate the ECC private key** for the Apache server:

   ```bash
   openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out apache-server-key-ecc.pem
   ```

   This command generates an ECC private key using the `prime256v1` curve.

2. **Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key apache-server-key-ecc.pem -out apache-server-ecc.csr
   ```

   - During the CSR generation process, you will be prompted to enter details such as country, state, organization name, and the server’s **Common Name (CN)**. The Common Name should be the server’s domain name (e.g., `example.com`).

---

## Step 2: Obtain a Signed Certificate

There are two main ways to obtain a signed certificate:

1. **Self-Signed Certificate** (for testing purposes):

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in apache-server-ecc.csr -signkey apache-server-key-ecc.pem -out apache-server-cert-ecc.pem
   ```

   This will create a self-signed certificate valid for one year.

2. **Signed by a Certificate Authority (CA)** (for production):

   - Submit the CSR (`apache-server-ecc.csr`) to a trusted Certificate Authority (e.g., Let’s Encrypt, DigiCert).
   - The CA will issue a signed ECC certificate, which you will then install on the Apache server.
   - Store the signed certificate file (e.g., `apache-server-cert-ecc.pem`) and CA intermediate certificates, if provided, in a secure location.

---

## Step 3: Configure Apache to Use the ECC Server Certificate

1. **Locate your Apache configuration file** (typically in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` on Ubuntu or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/` on CentOS). Open the configuration file you want to secure (e.g., `default-ssl.conf`).

2. **Add or Update the SSL Configuration with TLS and Cipher Settings**:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:443>
       ServerAdmin admin@example.com
       ServerName example.com

       DocumentRoot /var/www/html

       SSLEngine on
       SSLCertificateFile /path/to/apache-server-cert-ecc.pem
       SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/apache-server-key-ecc.pem

       # If using CA-signed certificates, include the CA bundle
       SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/ca-bundle.pem

       # Configure TLS protocol versions
       SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2 +TLSv1.3

       # Configure strong cipher suites
       SSLCipherSuite "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"

       # Enable forward secrecy
       SSLHonorCipherOrder on
       SSLCompression off
       SSLUseStapling on
       SSLStaplingCache "shmcb:/tmp/stapling_cache(128000)"

       <Directory /var/www/html>
           Require all granted
       </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

   - **SSLProtocol**: Limits TLS versions to TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 for security.
   - **SSLCipherSuite**: Specifies secure cipher suites that support ECC and prioritize security.
   - **SSLHonorCipherOrder**: Ensures the server’s cipher order is preferred for security.
   - **SSLCompression**: Disables SSL compression to prevent CRIME attacks.
   - **SSLUseStapling**: Enables OCSP stapling for improved certificate validation.
   - **SSLStaplingCache**: Sets a cache for OCSP stapling.

3. **Save and close** the configuration file.

---

## Step 4: Enable SSL in Apache

1. **Enable SSL Module** (if not already enabled):

   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod ssl
   ```

2. **Enable the SSL site** (for example, the `default-ssl` site on Ubuntu):

   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite default-ssl
   ```

3. **Restart Apache** to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

---

## Step 5: Verify the SSL Configuration

1. **Test the SSL configuration**:

   Use the following command to check the Apache configuration for any errors:

   ```bash
   sudo apachectl configtest
   ```

   If there are no errors, you should see `Syntax OK`.

2. **Verify SSL with OpenSSL**:

   You can verify the server’s SSL certificate by running:

   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect example.com:443
   ```

   This command will show the server’s certificate chain and verify if the certificate is properly installed.

3. **Browser Test**:

   - Open a browser and visit `https://example.com`.
   - Ensure the connection is secure by looking for the padlock icon next to the URL.

---

## Summary of Files Created

- **apache-server-key-ecc.pem**: ECC private key for the server.
- **apache-server-ecc.csr**: Certificate Signing Request for obtaining a certificate.
- **apache-server-cert-ecc.pem**: Signed ECC certificate file for the server.

---

With the ECC server certificate and TLS configuration set up on Apache, clients can now authenticate the server’s identity and establish a secure, trusted connection.
